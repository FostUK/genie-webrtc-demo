# Phaser Terminology

## Phaser Scene

Genie Screens extend Phaser Scenes and are automatically used by the gameflow set up in navigation.

## Event Emitter

The default Genie Gel buttons fire Phaser events. Events can be subscribed to or published to using the Genie [event bus](event-bus.md)

## Asset packs

Genie uses Phaser asset packs to load all its assets.
