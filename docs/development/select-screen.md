## How do I add a select screen to the game?
- In `src/main.js` import the Select screen:

```javascript
import { Select } from "../node_modules/genie/src/components/select.js";
```

- Then, in `src/main.js` add the select screen to the `screenConfig object`.

```javascript
const screenConfig = {
    ...
    home: {
        scene: Home,
        routes: {
            next: "character-select",
        },
    },
    "character-select": {
        scene: Select,
        routes: {
            next: "level-select",
            home: "home",
        },
    },
    ...
};
```

- When running the game, progressing from the home screen should now take the player to the character select screen.

## How do I add items to the select screen carousel?
- Locate the file `config.json` located inside `themes/your-theme/` (where `your-theme` is the name of your theme).
- Add a `"choices"` array to your select options and fill it with objects containing the keys `main` and `name`. These must be named the same as the key in your `asset-pack-master.json` file (see [below](#how-does-it-find-the-location-of-my-sprite-assets)).
    - `main`: This refers to the image of the thing the player is selecting. For example in a character select screen, this will be the character itself.
    - `name`: This refers to the image of the name of the thing the player is selecting. For example in a character select screen, it will simply be an image of the character's name.

```json
{
    "theme": {
        "character-select": {
            "choices": [
                {
                    "main": "dangermouse",
                    "name": "dangermouseName"
                },
                {
                    "main": "barney",
                    "name": "barneyName"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

## How does it find the location of my sprite assets?

- Locate the file `asset-pack-master.json` located inside `themes/your-theme/` (where `your-theme` is the name of your theme).
- Add your sprite locations and preferred key names to this file.

```javascript
{
    ...
    "character-select": {
        "prefix": "character-select.",
        "files": [
            {
                "type": "image",
                "key": "dangermouse",
                "url": "options/dangermouse_sel.png"
            },
            {
                "type": "image",
                "key": "dangermouseName",
                "url": "options/dangermouse_sel_name.png"
            },
            {
                "type": "image",
                "key": "barney",
                "url": "options/barney_sel.png"
            },
            {
                "type": "image",
                "key": "barneyName",
                "url": "options/barney_sel_name.png"
            }
        ]
    }
    ...
}
```
